I can send you one if you are one of the first few lucky people to try this kit :). Discord DM me.

### 0. Set up your Raspberry Pi

This kit has been tested on Raspberry Pi 4 and 5. If you just got your RPi, follow their [documentations](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html) to set it up.

ðŸ“· You will also need a camera attached to the RPi to test this out. [This](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5657) is the most standard RPi camera, but any camera should work.
ðŸ“¢ If you want to hear the narration, you will need to set up 11labs and attach a speaker to the RPi.

### 1. Create and activate your venv

```
python -m venv --system-site-packages rpi-venv
source rpi-venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Create an .env file

```
cp .env.example .env
```

### 4. Get OpenAI API key

Visit https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys to get your OpenAI API key and set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the `.env` file

### 5. Get Resend key

Visit https://resend.com/api-keys to get your Resend API key and set `RESEND_API_KEY` in the `.env` file

Note that before using Resend to send emails, you also need to verify your domain [here](https://resend.com/domains). Resend also has a helpful guide on [everything related to domains](https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/domains/introduction).

You can send text messages to your phone by email using your cellphone provider's email SMS gateway. See this article [here](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-send-a-text-from-your-email-account/) for how it works and common US providers' gateway.

### 6. (Optional) Get ElevenLabs key

a. Go to https://elevenlabs.io/, log in, and click on your profile picture on lower left. Select "Profile + API key". Copy the API key and save it as `ELEVEN_API_KEY` in the `.env` file

b. Select a 11labs voice by clicking on "Voices" on the left side nav bar and navigate to "VoiceLab". Copy the voice ID and save it as `ELEVEN_VOICE_ID` in `.env`

### 7. (Optional) Enable local object detection

Set `USE_LOCAL_MODEL` in your `.env` file to `true`. See variable `interesting_array` in `camera.py` for trigger objects. Helpful to cut down OpenAI calls but off by default to speed up start up time.

### 8. Run the program

```
python camera.py
```

The program will save all the pictures taken under /static folder.

### 8. Update the prompt!

You probably noticed that we have a default prompt in .env called `REQUEST_PROMPT` -- you can update this prompt and tell the AI model to detect other things! One example that worked for me is the following prompt -- I got a summary of what my cat was doing every minute.

`"You are an AI assistant who can send emails based on what you see in the picture.
   If you see a cat in the picture, send an email summarizing what it's doing. The email should include a description parameter, which is describing what the cat is doing.
   For example, the description could be 'The cat is playing with a ball.'"`
